<P>My goals include Graduating from the University of Maine with a degree in Business.  Find a solid job coming out of college and live on my own.  I am not trying to live in my parents basement ever. If possible I would like to start my own Business, maybe some kind of clothing brand or that I enjoy doing. That many involve opening a board shop that sells that will sell every kind of board available and skate and surf culture clothing.I want to me as or more successful as my Parents were with their Businesses.
