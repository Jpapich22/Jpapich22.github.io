<p> I went to Hingham Highschool and was very active.  School had always been challenging for me, I just never seem to get it just right. I turned to sports heavily to make up for it. I ran Cross Country all for years and ended up being very good at it as a junior I went to states my team placed 2nd good enough to go the all states.  A injury prevented me senior year from running staes we placed 4th. I didn't just run I played Basketball my first two years and Lacrosse for my first three years.  I was a captain on my Ultimate Frisbee team and put up the numbers to go with it.  I was also the Spanish Club treasurer and led lots of Spanish Club activities.<p>
