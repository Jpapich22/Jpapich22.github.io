<p>For starters I live in Hingham mass. I live with my younger brother, sister and parents. My parents both have there own businesses. My dad is a Landscape Architect and my mom is an Interior Designer. Some people say its a power couple, both extremely hard working people and as you would expect they hope that I do the same.<p>

<p>I've been in hingham since I was about 8 so I consider it my really home even thought my heart and family will always be in the midwest.  Hingham is a town of about 20,000 people so fairly small. Its near the ocean and is a hotspot for the summer. It's a super pretty town filled with people that love to fish and sail.  That was never really my cup of tea.<p>
